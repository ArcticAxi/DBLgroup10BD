				We are first-year students at Eindhoven University of Technology. At the end of the year we had a
				project to create a visualization tool for eye-tracking data. After 2 months of researching, designing and programming, we have finally 
				made a new tool for visualizing huge datasets (with eye-tracking data). It is now presented in front of you.
				iFish can give you insightful picture of your complicated data. For this purpose we have implemented popular visualization 
				techniques such as spatial heat map and bubble map. Moreover you can track user's eye path with the help of scanpath.
				Last but not least a statistical representation of the data in the form of boxplot can be illustrated as well.
				Now you have to just go to upload page, upload your data and ENJOY: ) </p>

				<p id = "ending">We wish you nice experience with the tool <br>
				From iFish team
